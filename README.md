# Marco Domingues

Backend-focused Software Engineer building production-grade systems with Kotlin, Java and Spring Boot.
I work with Clean Architecture, domain-driven design, real-time systems and secure APIs.
Strong emphasis on maintainability, code quality and CI-driven development.
I prefer software that survives production,not demos.

## What I build

- REST APIs and event-driven services
- JWT-secured systems with proper key management
- Real-time communication (WebSockets + Redis pub/sub)
- Modular backend architectures (DDD / Clean Architecture)
- CI/CD pipelines with enforced quality gates (SonarCloud, JaCoCo)

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin • Java • Spring Boot • PostgreSQL • MySQL
- Redis • Docker • Linux • GitHub Actions
- JUnit • MockK • Detekt • SonarCloud

## How I like to work
- Clear ownership
- Calm execution
- Strong testing discipline
- Focus on long-term maintainability
