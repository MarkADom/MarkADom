# Marco Domingues

Backend-focused software engineer working primarily with **Java and Kotlin**, 
building APIs and services with **Spring Boot**, clean architecture principles 
and a strong focus on maintainability and real-world constraints.

I’ve worked with **production systems** in automotive and client-facing contexts, 
close to domain logic, integrations, and long-term code ownership.

## What I work with
- Java / Kotlin
- Spring Boot, REST APIs
- PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Clean Architecture, modular design
- JWT authentication, WebSockets
- Linux, Docker, Git
- Unit testing (JUnit, Mockito, MockK)

## Selected projects
- **GeoLocateAPI** – Lightweight Java 17 microservice with Clean Architecture
- **SynchTask** – Collaborative backend system in Kotlin + Spring Boot
- **FileUploadAPI** – Secure file upload service with filesystem storage

## How I like to work
- Small teams
- Clear ownership
- Calm execution over hype
- Software that survives production, not demos
