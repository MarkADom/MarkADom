# Marco Domingues

Backend Engineer (Kotlin/Java) with production experience in automotive systems and real-time APIs.
I build reliable backend services using Spring Boot, clean architecture principles and strong testing discipline. Previously worked on BMW’s Connected Assistant (Android Automotive), delivering Kotlin-based features integrated with embedded systems and voice platforms. Currently focused on designing modular, secure APIs with JWT authentication, WebSockets and Redis, prioritizing maintainability and long-term scalability.

## What I build

- REST APIs and event-driven services
- JWT-secured systems with proper key management
- Real-time communication (WebSockets + Redis pub/sub)
- Modular backend architectures (DDD / Clean Architecture)
- CI/CD pipelines with enforced quality gates (SonarCloud, JaCoCo)

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin • Java • Spring Boot • PostgreSQL • MySQL
- Redis • Docker • Linux • GitHub Actions
- JUnit • MockK • Detekt • SonarCloud

## How I like to work
- Clear ownership
- Calm execution
- Strong testing discipline
- Focus on long-term maintainability
